I hold a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Bu-Ali Sina university and a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology. My academic journey led me to my core passion: Computer Graphics and High Performance Computing. Through these years beside my academic path, I also worked as an HPC engineer and did some web-development as well. Simultaneously, I pursued my passion for Computer Graphics through my personal projects and researches that I have carried out in this area. After gaining expreiences in both my academic and industry paths, I now find myself ready for a research position in Computer Graphics.
