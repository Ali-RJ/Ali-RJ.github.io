Noora is a Ray Tracer that I have implemented as my personal prjoects, which comes from own passion
for computer graphics and real-time rendering (though it is an off-line Ray Tracer now, but currently I am working on
its real-time version). It is actually a Monte Carlo Path Tracer that I have implemented it based on Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing
series and his algorithms.

# Future Works
I have plan to add other ray tracing algorithms to this ray tracer and more advanced numerical algorithms to it.
I also plan to change its backend to support CUDA, OpenGL and Vulkan.
