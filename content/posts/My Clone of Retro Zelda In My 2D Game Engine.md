This is a simple clone of the old famous game Legend of Zelda that I have created with my 2D game engine. I created an ECS 2D game engine using C++ and SFML (as a library for handling graphics and sound). Due to this software architecture, it is easy to create new levels in a script file and then use that file in the game as a level. I didn't pick any specific scripting language for this and it has a simple format for now. But as one of my goals in this project, I want to adopt the Lua language for handling scripts as it gets more complicated.

As I said for now it is using SFML as a graphics library and I plan to drop it out and replace it with my own graphics framework that deals with graphics (the same thing for the sound system).
For debugging and also for in-game menus I used Dear ImGui. Even though I can handle the menus via SFML, due to my plan for using OpenGL as the graphics library, I chose to use Dear ImGui cause it is exhausting work to implement menus and deal with texts in this library. In this specific game, I have implemented the backpack (inventory) in the Dear ImGui as well.

# Future works
Soon I will replace this clone with my own game which is still under development and as I said above I am going to implement the abilities of the library that I am currently using with my version.
