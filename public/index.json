[{"content":"Barzin is a software that I developed in C++ using the Qt library. I aimed to create a modern general inventory management system. For this reason, in parallel with the core capabilities, say adding products with different attributes or registering customers\u0026rsquo; orders, I tried to add some features to this software to make it distinctive from its common counterparts; feature like \u0026ldquo;Dark Mode\u0026rdquo; is one of my favorites among these features that I rarely see in common software in this area.\nBased on this vision, I didn\u0026rsquo;t try to create a super application that satisfies all your needs from managing your stash to organizing your checks. So Barzin is a more general one which indeed may let you down if you have some special needs; but on the other hand, if the core features could be enough for you, it would give you a suite of nice functionalities.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a fast and robust piece of software. By \u0026ldquo;robust\u0026rdquo;, I mean you never need to worry about if your changes on the system or your data would be lost at any stage of your work you are. I focused on getting rid of any cumbersome load of work that you may have to do, from adding any shape of data to removing them. You can easily find your data through the vast major database that holds lots of data. You can manage the \u0026ldquo;Units\u0026rdquo; that you use for products so that you don\u0026rsquo;t need to enter them all the time (regardless of the danger of redundant units) or you don\u0026rsquo;t need to search through an overwhelming list of units. In Barzin, you can easily manage your customers as well. You can select your old customer when you need instead of entering their name every time. It is also flexible in case of different types of products that you may want to add to your database (some may have expiration dates and some don\u0026rsquo;t for example). In the options, you would have a large number of items for configuring the software and fine-tuning different aspects of it.\nFeatures on the way: Online chat service for contacting the support team Export feature for the invoices in the PDF Supporting Persian language besides English ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/barzin-inventory-management-system/","summary":"Barzin is a software that I developed in C++ using the Qt library.
