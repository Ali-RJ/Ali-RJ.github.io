      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a simple clone of the old famous game Legend of Zelda that I have created with my 2D game engine. I created an ECS 2D game engine using C++ and SFML (as a library for handling graphics and sound). Due to this software architecture, it is easy to create new levels in a script file and then use that file in the game as a level. I didn&amp;rsquo;t pick any specific scripting language for this and it has a simple format for now. But as one of my goals in this project, I want to adopt the Lua language for handling scripts as it gets more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
