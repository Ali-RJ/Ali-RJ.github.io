      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gandom is a software rasterizer that mimics algorithms which are behind graphics
APIs and even what are implemented physically on GPUs.
In this project, I have implemented what graphics APIs and GPUs do to render
and syntheis an image over the display, completely with a code which
runs over CPU. Many algorithms were implemented in this software from rendering
a triangle to clipping that triangle and back face culling and etc.
Here are some images from Gandom:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Noora is a Ray Tracer that I have implemented as my personal prjoects, which comes from own passion
for computer graphics and real-time rendering (though it is an off-line Ray Tracer now, but currently I am working on
its real-time version). It is actually a Monte Carlo Path Tracer that I have implemented it based on Peter Shirley&amp;rsquo;s Ray Tracing
series and his algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;future-works&#34;&gt;Future Works&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have plan to add other ray tracing algorithms to this ray tracer and more advanced numerical algorithms to it.
I also plan to change its backend to support CUDA, OpenGL and Vulkan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
