      <title>Inventory Management System Software</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a software that I developed in C++ using the Qt library. I aimed to create a modern general inventory management system.
For this reason, in parallel with the core capabilities, say adding products with different attributes or registering customers&amp;rsquo; orders,
I tried to add some features to this software to make it distinctive from its common counterparts; feature like &amp;ldquo;Dark Mode&amp;rdquo; is one of my
favorites among these features that I rarely see in common software in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Anahita Render Engine</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a renderer that I have developed for the bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree project. In the beginning, I used the Blinn-Phong rendering model for it and now I am working on implementing a physically-based rendering model. For controlling the objects in the scene from light sources to complicated mesh objects and for the sake of debugging, I also implemented a GUI using Dear ImGui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;View&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://ali-rj.github.io/images/anahita/anahita-gui.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can load meshes to the scene through GUI that under the hood uses the Assimp library and besides that, you can control each object&amp;rsquo;s attributes. There is a scene graph that controls all objects on the scene and in addition to these, you can add and configure different sources of light on the scene. Unfortunately, the shaders are hard-coded for now, but I plan to take care of that too in the future. Below the GUI there is a log widget that shows warnings errors and all other sorts of messages that you may need.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Retro Zelda Clone in My Own 2D Game Engine</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a simple clone of the old famous game Legend of Zelda that I have created with my 2D game engine. I created an ECS 2D game engine using C++ and SFML (as a library for handling graphics and sound). Due to this software architecture, it is easy to create new levels in a script file and then use that file in the game as a level. I didn&amp;rsquo;t pick any specific scripting language for this and it has a simple format for now. But as one of my goals in this project, I want to adopt the Lua language for handling scripts as it gets more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hold a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Electrical Engineering from Bu-Ali Sina university and a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology. My academic journey led me to my core passion: Computer Graphics and High Performance Computing. Through these years beside my academic path, I also worked as an HPC engineer and did some web-development as well. Simultaneously, I pursued my passion for Computer Graphics through my personal projects and researches that I have carried out in this area. After gaining expreiences in both my academic and industry paths, I now find myself ready for a research position in Computer Graphics.
I will be glad to send my resume to you upon your request: &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:ali.rajabi20@yahoo.com&#34;&gt;ali.rajabi20 [at] yahoo [dot] com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
